title: Visual Foresight With a Local Dynamics Model 
---

**Abstract:** Model-free policy learning has been shown to be capable of learning manipulation policies which can solve long-time horizon tasks using single-step 
manipulation primitives. However, training these policies is a time-consuming process requiring large amounts of data. We propose the Local Dynamics Model (LDM) 
which efficiently learns the state-transition function for these manipulation primitives. By combining the LDM with model-free policy learning, we can learn 
policies which can solve complex manipulation tasks using one-step lookahead planning. We show that the LDM is both more sample-efficient and outperforms other 
model architectures. When combined with planning, we can outperform other model-based and model-free policies on several challenging manipulation tasks in simulation.
